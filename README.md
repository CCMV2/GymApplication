This is the repository for our brand new Gym Application.
Requirements:
A gym owner has requested that we build a web application, which will hande the following:
1. Management of trainers, subscriptions and available rooms by an administrator
2. Management of classes by an administrator or a trainer
3. Client registration by a trainer
4. Adding and extending client subscriptions by a trainer
5. Managing users to classes by a trainer


The gym owner has also expressed the desire to extend that web application in two additional steps.
The first step will include:
1. An extension of the web application on the client side, which will contain:
a) a home page
b) info pages about the trainers
c) info pages about the subscriptions
d) a schedule page
e) a contact page with the location of the gym placed in a Google Maps container
f) a client login page
2. The info pages will contain an image, a description, the price if it's a subscription page, and a feedback mechanism based on stars (1 being the worse and 5 the best). Only logged in clients can give feedbacks.
3. The schedule page displays the schedule for a specific week.
It has a tabular form and it must respect the following colouring principles:
        - light grey for classes that are already in the past
        - green for classes of easy intensity
        - orange for classes of medium intensity
        - red for classes of high intensity
The name of the class and the trainer should also be visible in each tab.
4. According the user the possibility to manage himself the classes he/she wants to attend to

The second step will include:
1. Extending the web application on the administration side, which will contain:
a) one extra page where administrators can send periodic mails to clients, containing important informations, discounts, new classes, etc.
The new page must contain:
  - a Subject input
  - a Body input
  - a subscription list
Mails shall be then sent to all the clients which will have active subscription(s) found under the selected subscription(s)
